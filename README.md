# Quadcopter Simulation and Control (Quad.PySim)

Looking into Quad Simulation using Python.

This project will serve 2 purposes. The first is to create quadcopter dynamics and outputing the relevant equations of motion. The second purpose is to provide a simple simulation of the quadcopter's dynamics and a simple controller that can handle position control and supports minimum snap trajectory generation.
